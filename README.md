## Summary
The Snake Game was fun project to build that allowed me to further work on my Javascript skills. The project has several involved challenges where I had to tweak by experimenting code with various data types to make it responsive and to overcome each challenge one at a time. I learned the following:
- Objects creation and manipulate the objects via accessing its properities.
- Practiced programming logic.
- Drew objects on canvas.
- Conditional statements.
- Listening to keyboard events.
