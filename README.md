## Summary
I enjoyed building this game because it allowed me to further instill my understanding of programming concepts and to have hands-on experience in the software development life-cycle using JavaScript. I learned to tweak with data types to make it responsive. A very cool UI features were integrated to apply shadow lighting on the background and make the snake glow every time it eats an apple! Give it a try and let me know if you like it!
