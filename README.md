## Summary
The Snake Game was fun project to develop that allowed me to further work on my basic Javascript skills. The project has several involved challenges where I had to tweak by experimenting with various data types to make it work and to overcome each challenge one at a time.
 in which I learned the following:
- Objects creation and manipulate the objects via accessing its properities.
- Programming logic.
- Draw objects on canvas.
- Conditional statements.
- Listening to keyboard events.
